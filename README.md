# SPARCLUR - Some PDF Analyzers and Renderer Comparators: LevelUp Research

SPARCLUR (Sparclur) is a a collection of various wrappers for extant PDF 
parsers and renderers and tools for comparing and analyzing the outputs from
these parsers.

## Parsers
* MuPDF
* QPDF
* Poppler (pdftoppm and pdftocairo)
* Ghostscript

## Tools
## Parser Trace Comparator (PTC)
Gather and normalize warning and error messages from extant parsers.

## PDF Renderer Comparator (PRC)

The PRC compares different renderers over the same documents and can also be used
to visualize the differences and produce a similarity metric.
