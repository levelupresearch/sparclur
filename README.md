# SPARCLUR - Some PDF Analyzers and Renderer Comparators: LevelUp Research

SPARCLUR (Sparclur) is a collection of various wrappers for extant PDF 
parsers and renderers and tools for comparing and analyzing the outputs from
these parsers.

## Parsers
The following parsers need to either be installed or the binaries need to be built and accessible to fully leverage Sparclur.

### Arlington DOM Checker
The repo should be cloned and instructions for building the TestGrammar tool should be followed. SPARCLUR needs to be
pointed to the top-level directory of the cloned repo to access the DOM files and the TestGrammar tool.

https://github.com/pdf-association/arlington-pdf-model

### Ghostscript
Ghostscript needs to be installed using your preferred package manager with the `gs` command linked in your `PATH`, or 
the binary can be built and referenced at run-time within SPARCLUR.

https://www.ghostscript.com/

### MuPDF
MuPDF requires the binary installed or built as well as the Python wrapper package PyMuPDF.

https://mupdf.com/

https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### PDFCPU
PDFCPU is a Go based PDF processor. So both Go and PDFCPU will need to be installed/built. Binary can go into the `PATH`,
config, or entered at run-time.

https://pdfcpu.io/

### PDFMiner
PDFMiner is a Python based parser. The package needs to be installed into the working environment.

https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Poppler
Poppler and XPDF have binary name collisions, so only one can be referenced in `PATH`. The binary can be set in the
SPARCLUR config or at class instantiation.

https://poppler.freedesktop.org/

### QPDF
QPDF needs to be built/installed and the binary can be added to `PATH` or can be set in the config or
at run-time.

https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/

### XPDF
Poppler and XPDF have binary name collisions, so only one can be referenced in `PATH`. The binary can be set in the
SPARCLUR config or at class instantiation.

## Config
A sparclur.yaml file can be set in the top-level SPARCLUR folder. Parameters for the various parser classes can
be set, such as binary paths and other default values. See the `examples` directory for an example yaml file.

## Tools
See the `examples` directory for Jupyter noteboooks showcasing the following tools.

### Parser Wrappers
SPARCLUR's extensible parser wrapper API's provide methods for:
* Document Rendering
* Text Extraction
* Trace message collection and normalization
* Document reforging for document cleaning and recovery
* Information extraction 
  * Font information
  * Object keys and values
  * Image data

### Parser Trace Comparator (PTC)
Gather and normalize warning and error messages from extant parsers.

### PDF Renderer Comparator (PRC)
The PRC compares different renderers over the same documents and can also be used
to visualize the differences and produce a similarity metric.

### PDF Text Comparator (PXC)
API's for extracting and comparing text between parsers.

### Spotlight
Runs all available API's for a parser and creates the reforges of the document. Signatures are generated for the
reforges and the original and compared to produce a similarity score between documents over each parser.
All of these results are collected for analysis.

### Roll Back
An incremental update tool, that detects incremental updates and provides an API to pass a specific update
into SPARCLUR parsers or save it to disk. It also does some text and rendering comparisons between consecutive versions
and returns plots of these metrics.

### Detect Chaos
Check documents for non-deterministic behavior within the SPARCLUR-wrapped parsers.

### Highlight
This tool has a very specific use case by analyzing explicitly modified PDF's with their original file in
order to find rendering differentials introduced by the modification.

### Astrotruther
Another specialized tool. This trains models for classifying the validity of PDF's using the 
trace messages from the parsers. This requires a labeled training set.

## Streamlit Interface

Running light_the_sparclur.sh will launch a Streamlit web app that will provide an interface for 
exploring PDF's using the PTC and PRC.
